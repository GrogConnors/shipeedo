    <li>GST</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Terms used in this clause 13 that have a particular meaning in the GST Act have the same
            meaning in this clause. Any reference to GST payable by a party, or to an input tax credit

            of, the representative member of any GST group of which that party is a member.
        </li>
        <li>All consideration for any taxable supply provided for by these Terms or any related document
            or agreement is exclusive of GST unless the contrary is clear. The amount of that
            consideration must be increased by an additional amount equal to the GST on that taxable
            supply. The party who has to pay the additional amount must pay it at the same time as the
            consideration in respect of that taxable supply becomes due or, if the supplier has to pay (or
            allow credit against) the relevant GST before then, the additional amount must be paid at that
            earlier time.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an amount of consideration under these Terms or any related document or agreement is
            calculated as specific compensation or reimbursement for an expense, loss or liability of a
            supplier, the consideration must be calculated after excluding any amount for which the
            supplier is entitled to an input tax credit as recipient of the item to which the expenses, loss or
            liability relates.
        </li>
        <li>
            A party is not obliged to make any payment for GST unless it is provided with a tax invoice
            which complies with the GST Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            If at any time an adjustment is made or required to be made between a party and the relevant
            taxing authority on account of any amount paid as GST under these Terms or any related
            document or agreement:
            <ol>
                <li>a corresponding adjustment must be made;</li>
                <li>adjustment notes must be issued; and</li>
                <li>any payment must be made,</li>

            from receipt of a notice delivered to the address which the Customer gave to the Company on
            delivery of the Goods. If the Customer fails to do so, the Company may remove the Goods and store them in
            such a manner and in such a place as the Company thinks appropriate at
            the Customer's expense and risk.

                <li>Goods moving by airfreight are subject to the applicable Airfreight Convention. The
                    Customer’s recovery of loss or damage, if any, is against the airline carrier and is
                    limited in accordance with the Airfreight Convention or any other conventions that may
                    be applicable. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by the Customer whilst the
                    Goods are in the possession of the airline carrier, the Company will seek to recover on
                    behalf of the Customer from the principal airline carrier amounts payable under the
                    aforementioned conventions as they are applicable. The Customer will indemnify,
                    defend and hold the Company, its Related Companies and the Company Personnel
                    harmless against any claims for loss or damage to their Goods incurred whilst they
                    were in the possession of the airline carrier;
                </li>
                <li>Goods moving by seafreight are subject to the applicable international treaties
                    including the Hague Rules. The Customer’s right to recovery of loss or damage, if any,
                    is against the seafreight Carrier and is limited in accordance with the Hague Rules or
                    any other conventions that may be applicable. In the event of any loss or damage
                    suffered by the Customer whilst the Goods are in the possession of the seafreight
                    Carrier, the Company will seek to recover on behalf of the Customer from the Carrier
                    amounts payable by the Hague Rules as they are applicable. The Customer will
                    indemnify, defend and hold the Company, its Related Companies and the Company
                    Personnel harmless against any claims for loss or damage to their Goods incurred
                    whilst they were in the possession of the seafreight Carrier;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Goods moving by airfreight or seafreight may necessarily involve a part of transport
                    undertaken by other means in order to comply with the terms of an Order. Where this
                    is so, and no international treaty is applicable which covers the additional transport,
                    the Customer’s recovery of loss or damage, if any, is against the Carrier and is limited
                    in accordance with the convention applicable for the majority of the transport, even
                    where that convention does not envisage liability of the kind of transport concerned. In
                    the event of any loss or damage suffered by the Customer whilst the Goods are in the
                    possession of a third party Carrier, the Company will seek to recover on behalf of the
                    Customer from the third party Carrier amounts payable by these conventions as they
                    are applicable. The Customer will indemnify, defend and hold the Company, its
                    Related Companies and the Company Personnel harmless against any claims for loss
                    or damage to their Goods incurred whilst they were in the possession of the third-party
                    Carrier where such Carriage was necessary in order to comply with the terms of an
                    Order.

        <li>
            Where any legislation implies or imposes a guarantee, term, condition, warranty, undertaking,

            exclude that guarantee, term, condition, warranty, undertaking, inducement or representation
            (Non-Excludable Provision), and the Company is able to limit the remedy of the Customer
            for a breach of the Non-Excludable Provision, then the Company’s liability for breach of the
            Non-Excludable Provision is limited to (at the Company’s election) to the supply of the services
            again (or the payment of the cost of doing so).

            Subject to the Company’s obligations under the Non-Excludable Provisions and clause 16.4,

            series of connected claims under this document or in connection with its subject matter,

        <li>
            Subject to the Company’s obligations under the Non-Excludable Provisions, the Company is

            document or its subject matter, whether arising in or for breach of contract, negligence or other
            tort, breach of statutory duty, breach of warranty or guarantee, under an indemnity or
            otherwise and whether or not that loss was foreseeable, even if the Company has been

            Any claim for loss or damage must be notified in writing to the Company within 48 hours of
            delivery of the Goods or of the date upon which the Goods should have been delivered.
        </li>
        <li>
            If no claim for loss or damage is made within 48 hours of delivery of the Goods then the
            Customer is deemed to have accepted the Goods and to the fullest extent permitted by law,
            waives any claim for loss or damage against the Company in respect of the Services.

    <li>Negotiation of Extension of Responsibility/Liability/Warranty/Insurance</li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Upon negotiation with the Customer in writing, the Company may agree to greater
            responsibility and liability than set out in paragraph 26 above upon payment of additional
            charges by the Customer as required. Applicable rates for greater responsibility and liability
            are subject of discussion and negotiation between the parties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Should the Customer not choose nor the parties agree to the Company taking greater
            responsibility and liability for the Services for additional charge pursuant to clause 28.1 above,
            the parties agree that the Company provides a lower cost service on the premise that it has
            the right to exclude or limit liability and/or seek indemnity as provided for in this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additionally or alternatively, the Customer may choose and agree with the Company at extra
            cost that the Company provide a conditional warranty with warranty/liability limit in respect of
            loss or damage to Goods subject to the Company’s warranty terms and conditions
            (“WTCs”)(see – insert link to WTCs on in website) and which if applicable are supplementary
            terms to this agreement and incorporated herein.
        </li>
        <li>
            Depending on the level of responsibility and liability or warranty cover agreed or arranged as
            between the Customer and the Company pursuant to clauses 28.1 to 28.3 above, the
            Customer should consider obtaining its own insurance to cover for loss or damage it may incur
            that is not fully indemnified by the Company or warranties as agreed. No insurance will be
            arranged or effected by the Company on the Customer’s behalf except pursuant to clause 16
            of this agreement.
